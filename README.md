This repo contains the tooling and infrastructure configurations for creating
Kubernetes releases from the [kubernetes/kubernetes] main repository.

There are several scripts and helpers in this repository a Release Manager will
find useful when managing all kinds of releases (alpha, beta, official, rc)
across branches.

Golang-based tools can be built via the `compile-release-tools` script.
Individual tools can be installed via `go install k8s.io/release/cmd/$TOOL@latest`.

## Release Creation

If you create a new release for this repository, then the
[goreleaser](https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser) GitHub action will attach
all available binary artifacts to it automatically. To publish those artifacts
to our [`k8s-artifacts-sig-release` GCS bucket](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/k8s-artifacts-sig-release),
run the following [kpromo](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/promo-tools)
command for the new `$TAG`:

```bash
kpromo gh \
    --org kubernetes \
    --repo release \
    --bucket k8s-artifacts-sig-release \
    --tags $TAG
```

The release notes can be generated by using the
[release-notes](cmd/release-notes) tool from this repository, which is also
available as binary artifact:

```bash
release-notes \
    --org kubernetes \
    --repo release \
    --required-author "" \
    --start-rev $PREVIOUS_TAG \
    --end-rev $TAG \
    --output release-notes.md
```
