	Use:     "fast-forward --branch <release-branch> [--ref <main-ref>] [--nomock] [--cleanup]",
	Short:   "Fast forward a Kubernetes release branch",
	Aliases: []string{"ff"},
	Long: fmt.Sprintf(`fast-forward fast forwards a branch to a specified git object (defaults to %s).

krel fast-forward pre-checks that the provided branch to be forwarded is an
actual 'release-x.y' branch and that the branch exists remotely. If that is not
the case, krel fast-forward will fail.

If no branch is provided, then krel will try to find the latest upstream k/k
release branch. If this release branch already contains a final minor release,
then krel ff will do nothing at all.

After that preflight-check, the release branch will be checked out and krel
verifies that the latest merge base tag is the same for the main and the
release branch. This means that only the latest release branch can be fast
forwarded.

Additionally, krel lists all k/sig-release issues and searches for the
one with the title "Cut vx.y.0 release". If that exists and is open, then
krel will skip the fast-forward, because it may happen that a fast-forward
produces merge conflicts in git when comparing with the already staged sources.

krel merges the provided ref into the release branch and asks for a final
confirmation if the push should really happen. The push will only be executed
as real push if the '--nomock' flag is specified.

If --non-interactive is set to true, then krel will not require any user
interaction.  This mode is mainly made for CI purposes.

If --submit is set to true, then krel fast-forward will run by submitting a new
Google Cloud Build job.
